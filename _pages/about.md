I'm a statistician/data scientist dedicated to increasing the joy and well-being of people and our planet through increasing the quality of relationships we have between each other and our environment.

I leverage my strength in math and quantitative thinking to use data-oriented means to progress toward this goal in my career, but have also been a teacher, advocate, activist, and leader in various other contexts and efforts toward this end. I am particularly interested in progressing toward this goal in the context of immigration, community wellness, children and families, mental health, and environmental/climate justice.

My belief is that statistics should be on the front lines of any effort to create positive change. I echo Daniel Kahneman's sentiment that we should all think like statisticians, as it fosters critical thinking that help us recognize nuance, make wiser decisions and create happier relationships.

I am currently looking for work, either contract/freelance (see website for [Wit^2](https://witsquared.com)) or as an employee, where I can use my skills to further causes aligned with my above-mentioned goals.
Outside of my quantitative pursuits, you can find me playing with my daughter, hanging out with my wife, being a nerd with some friends, exploring nature by foot or bike, or throwing a yo-yo.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
