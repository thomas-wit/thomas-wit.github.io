> My personal philosophy based on my experience as well as claims I've heard in academic settings: We learn things at a much deeper level when we can dive deep into them, apply them, then teach them to others. Books allow for a depth of learning that quick-answering resources still can't offer. But it takes a genuine interest, and time to commit - counterintuitive to our fast-paced culture.
